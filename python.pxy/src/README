                           PXY version 1.0
                           ===============
                           
PXY (pronounded Pixie) is a simple file format that allows a structured
representation of data and is easily and directly translated into XML. 

The basic format is as shown below:

    document:
        element:
            attribute = 'string'
            {namespace}child: 'simple content'
            
Each element is denoted as an NCName followed by a colon, it may then be
specified as a simple content by adding the content on the same line. If
the element has complex content then the element must be followed by its 
content on following, *indented* lines. Indentation is important to PXY
In the same way as Python code to denote scope. 

Also note that namespaces can be used, using the convention supported by
ElementTree where the namespace becomes a prefix for the name but is
separated using braces.

The two modules pxy and pxy.pxml are used to convert between PXY source 
and Python dictionaries and between PXY source and XML respectively.
